    <h1> CLASSES OF FOOD </h1>
    <p>The classification of food is based on macronutrients and micronutrients.
        Macronutrients usually include water, fiber, fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. 
        They are needed for our bodies in large quantities. Micronutrients include vitamins
        and minerals.</p>
